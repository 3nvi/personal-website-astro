# About <br /> me

I was born in Athens in 1991 - (pause for a bit to do the math) -, where I attended the National Technical University of Athens as an
Electrical & Computer engineer. I always wanted to become a pilot, but some things don't work out the way you want them to.

For over 10 years, I’ve been working as a Web Engineer, mainly focused on front-end and performance. Most of my roles have been at the Senior or Lead level,
where I’ve helped architect and launch large-scale apps. I like to share what I learn—successes, mistakes, all of it—through articles, mostly about React, Next.js, GraphQL,
and web performance. While I don’t usually call myself a fullstack developer,
I’ve worked across the stack and feel confident designing and building end-to-end apps, usually on AWS or GCP.

I'm passionate about creating value for people and feel most motivated when I can make a real difference in their lives. I usually choose startups
because I like to avoid all the red tape and enjoy seeing the direct impact of what I build.

Lastly, I love F1, vintage motorcycles, cycling, hiking, DnD & World of Warcraft. Embarrassingly, I still play the latter.
